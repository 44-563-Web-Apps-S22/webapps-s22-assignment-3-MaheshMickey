        <p>Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer, uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore</p>
        <ul>
            <li>George Freeth is the person who brought surfing to California</li>
            <li>The biggest wave recorded was 530 meters in Lituya bay, southern coast of Alaska.</li>
            <li>There are two types of surfing; short boarding and long boarding</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Short boarding is considered harder than long boarding because it requires more effort</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The longest ride ever done on a wave was 37 minutes in Pororoca.</li>
        </ul>
